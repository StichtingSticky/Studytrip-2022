        <p>
          ASML is a high-tech company, headquartered in the Netherlands. 
          We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. 
          What we do is at the heart of all the electronic devices that keep us informed, entertained and connected. 
          Every day, you use electronics that simply wouldn’t exist without our machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Changing the world, one nanometer at a time</b><br/>
          Through the development of smaller, faster and still more affordable chips, the world’s technology has steadily evolved. A
          SML is always striving to do more to solve some of humanity’s toughest challenges through groundbreaking technology. 
          By pushing technology to new limits, we unlock the potential of both people and society.<br/><br/>
